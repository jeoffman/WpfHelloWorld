# WpfHelloWorld
Just playing with WPF, MVVM, and pain.

## Dependency Injection
Of course!

## Document File
Save me!

## Service Layer
What's up with the Model vs. the ViewModel and how can I keep my "business concerns" separated? Well, I don't know but I am trying to figure out what "fits". 

# TODO:
* fix the "busy GUI" to protect the call to the counter service from reentering
* File Associations for the extension
* I'm sure you'll think of something...
